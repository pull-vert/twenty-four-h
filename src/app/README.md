# Vue.js standup app

A small Vue.js 2.0 frontend app for a daily standup application. It is built with Webpack and runs tests with Karma + Jasmine.

The app was originally built with the [Vue CLI Webpack template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack)

The server side is a REST API built with [Spring](https://spring.io/) JVM framework.

Using [Bootstrap-Vue](https://bootstrap-vue.github.io/docs/components/)

## Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
# the output files end up in the src/ratpack/static folder for exclusion in the Ratpack executable JAR file.
npm run build

# run unit tests
npm run test
```
